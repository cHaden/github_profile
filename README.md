# Github Profile Page

## Description

Recreate your Github profile page (with real, live data) in a Rails application.  Use Github's public API.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand how organizations present information via APIs.
* Be able to read API documentation and interpret both request and response descriptions.
* Be able to build a Rails application to consume and present data from a public-facing JSON API.

## Deliverables

* **A Repository.** Create your own repository for this assignment.

## Normal Mode

In this assignment, you will be building a Rails application which consumes information from the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and presents it back to the user on one of your own views.  When the user sees the view in your application (perhaps at `localhost:3000/repositories/`), it should show them a page that looks as much like your github profile repositories page as possible.  Here is an example link to the repositories page:

https://github.com/masonfmatthews?tab=repositories

You will notice a lot going on on this page, from styling to navigation bars to icons.  Make it as similar as you can (stealing whatever styles you like), but keep in mind that the most important part is for the information on the page to be accurate and complete.

Your Rails application will not need to have any database tables.

## Hard Mode

For Hard Mode, implement your Public Activity Page in a second view.
